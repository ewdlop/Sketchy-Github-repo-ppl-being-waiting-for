# Security Policy

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is an **educational resource** focused on demonstrating SQL injection vulnerabilities and their prevention. All code examples showing vulnerable patterns are clearly marked and intended solely for learning purposes.

## 🔐 SQL Injection Prevention

### Vulnerable Code Examples

This repository contains examples of SQL injection vulnerabilities marked as:
- **❌ VULNERABLE - DO NOT USE**
- These examples show common mistakes that lead to SQL injection

### Secure Code Examples

The repository also provides secure alternatives marked as:
- **✅ SECURE - USE THIS**
- These examples demonstrate proper prevention techniques

## 📋 Educational Materials

The following resources are available in this repository:

1. **[SQL Injection Prevention Guide](/public/SQL-Injection-Prevention-Guide.md)**
   - Comprehensive security guide
   - Side-by-side vulnerable vs. secure code examples
   - Best practices and defense-in-depth strategies

2. **[Halloween SQL Queries](/public/🎃.md)**
   - Creative SQL examples with Halloween themes
   - SQL injection attack patterns
   - Prevention techniques

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Use vulnerable code examples in production
- ❌ Copy-paste code without understanding security implications
- ❌ Test SQL injection attacks on systems you don't own
- ❌ Use this knowledge for malicious purposes

### DO:
- ✅ Learn from the examples to write secure code
- ✅ Always use parameterized queries in production
- ✅ Test your own applications for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Share knowledge to improve overall security

## 🛡️ Core Security Principles

### 1. Parameterized Queries
Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:

```python
# ✅ Correct
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# ❌ Wrong
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

### 2. Input Validation
While not a replacement for parameterized queries, validate all inputs:
- Check data types
- Enforce length limits
- Use whitelists when possible

### 3. Least Privilege
- Use database accounts with minimal necessary permissions
- Separate read and write operations
- Never use admin/root accounts for applications

### 4. Error Handling
- Don't expose database errors to end users
- Log errors securely for debugging
- Return generic error messages

### 5. Defense in Depth
- Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits
- Keep software updated

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Understand the Vulnerability**
   - Read the vulnerable examples
   - Understand how attacks work

2. **Learn Prevention**
   - Study secure code examples
   - Practice writing parameterized queries

3. **Test and Verify**
   - Use automated tools (SQLMap, OWASP ZAP)
   - Test in safe, controlled environments

4. **Apply Knowledge**
   - Write secure code in your projects
   - Review existing code for vulnerabilities
   - Share knowledge with your team

## 🤝 Contributing

If you'd like to contribute additional examples or improvements:
- Ensure all vulnerable examples are clearly marked
- Provide corresponding secure alternatives
- Include explanations of why code is vulnerable or secure
- Add references to authoritative sources
